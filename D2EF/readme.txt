This subdirectory contains a quickly adapted version of ALeX's Disk2EasyFlash. Thanks for letting me use D2EF!

The modifications are mostly removing everything that does not compile with vanilla Circle etc.

The original source code can be found in this repository: https://github.com/alexkazik/disk2easyflash
